        <h2>How to do a picture-in-picture edit using Adobe Premiere Pro</h2>
        <p>Ever wondered how you can create a video where one clip is playing in the background while another plays on top of it? Widely known as the picture-in-picture effect,
            using tis technique makes it that much easier to get a point across as we can use whatever visual aid we need in the background as we explain it. Let's take a look at 
            how we can go about achieving this look without much of a hassle.</p>
        <h3>Create a footage card</h3>
        <p>1. Use the effects contorl panel to scale and position the adjust the general view of the desired clip.
        </p><br>
        <p>2. Place the clip that needs to be made a hole through above the the adjusted clip.
        </p><br>
        <p>3. Resize and alter the position of the clip so that it fits and the important items are visible throughout.
        </p><br>
        <p>4. Make sure the required part of the clip is being used.</p>
        <h3>Add a border</h3>
        <p>1. Create a text layer between the two footage layers in the timeline.
        </p><br>
        <p>2. Delete the text inside it using the essential graphics panel.
        </p><br>
        <p>3. Click on the page button and add the corresponding shape to the view.
        </p><br>
        <p>4. Resize it to be just slightly larger than the footage card, which will give it the look of a border.
        </p>
        <h3>Nest all the clips into one unit</h3>
        <p>1. Hightlight both the clips along with the text layer, which now contains the border. Then right-click and select nest.
        </p><br>
        <p>2. Now if you need to implement any animations or effects to the clips, you can add them directly to the nested unit without appying them one by one to each clip.
        </p>
        <h3>Make it full screen</h3>
        <p>1. Create a 5 seconds long color matte with the same resolution.
        </p><br>
        <p>2. Add two keyframes at the begining for position and size.
        </p><br>
        <p>3. Move to the end of the color matte and adjust the position and the size to the desired measurements.
        </p><br>
        <p>Save it as a preset for later reference.
        </p>
        <h3>Summery</h3>
        <p>Use these general steps and create an easy picture-in-picture effect within your edit. You can tweak the appearance of it by simply playing around with the effects control panels of
            the text layer and the footage card. BUT always make sure to are happy with how it looks before nesting the layers.
