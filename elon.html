        <h2>The Inspiring Story of Elon Musk</h2>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>If you pay any attention to science, technology or space travel, the odds of you being unaware of who Elon Musk, are zero to none. Having had his fair share of exposure 
            and experience in various fields, through the many giant, pioneering companies he’s been involved in, such as SpaceX, Tesla, Zip2 and x.com-which later became PayPal, 
            it’s not much of a surprise to anybody that, as of today, this visionary entrepreneur is the second richest person on planet earth.
            Born on the 28th of June 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, he was the oldest son of Errol Musk, his father, who was an engineer and Maye Musk, his mother, who was pursuing 
            a career in modeling at the time. Musk grew up with two younger siblings. A sister and a brother. While being born into an affluent family might’ve contributed to it in the 
            long run, reaching the level of success that he has reached, has only been possible through years and years of hard work, perseverance and countless sacrifices that he’s made 
            throughout the years.  
        </p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>As once described by Musk himself, he has been a massive book worm ever since he was a little kid. Which unfortunately ended up making his school days a brutal experience. 
            He was constantly bullied for just being himself. When he was only 9 years old, his parents separated, which forced him to live with his father, whom he has later referred 
            to as a terrible human being. While all this was going on, there was one thing which he could always count on, to help him power through this difficult period of time in his life. 
            His passion for technology.
            By the age of 12, this self-taught programmer had become familiar enough with computer programming to create a video game called “Blaster” which he later sold to 
            a magazine for $500. Having found what he loved to do, he decided to keep working on his programming skills, which in turn made his day to day life that much more tolerable.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving to Canada</h3>
        <p>At 17, with the help of his Canadian-born mother, he moved to Canada to avoid serving in the South African military. 
            In addition to that, he believed that, compared to Africa, living in the USA or Canada would expose him to so many more opportunities. After immigrating to Canada, 
            he enrolled in Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. After 2 years at Queen’s University, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he 
            did his B. Sc. In Economics and B.A. in Physics. Both of which ended up helping him determine his career path and making it easier for him to choose the best 
            business opportunities as now he could consider both the scientific and financial perspectives before making decisions. One could argue that this was the determining factor 
            of his vast success as an entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <h3>Startup phase</h3>
        <p>When he was 24, he moved to California with the intention of continuing his education by pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Physics at Stanford University. 
            Despite that being his initial intention, as the dot-com boom was just starting to gain momentum, he decided to leave the Ph.D. program and double down on 
            starting his fascinating endeavor as an entrepreneur.
        </p> <br>
        <p>In 1995, along with his younger brother, he established Zip2, a web software company that provided online city guides for newspapers. After years of hard work and 
            countless sleepless nights, in 1999, Zip2 was acquired by a computer company called Compaq for $340 million. Without resting on his laurels, he decided to pour the money he 
            made from Zip2 into creating X.com, which later renamed as PayPal. In 2002, when eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 Billion, he was left with $180 Million worth of shares. 
            From those funds he spent about $70 Million on Tesla Motors, an automobile manufacturing company with the goal of revolutionizing the industry by producing high functioning 
            electric cars, which absolutely nobody thought was an achievable goal at the time. Then he went on to spend $100 Million to found SpaceX, an interstellar travel company, 
            with which he was trying to make space travel more affordable by developing reusable rocket boosters, which again was an impossible task in many people’s eyes. In 2007, 
            proving the doubters wrong, Tesla Motors unveiled the Tesla Roadster. In 2015, after years of trial and error SpaceX managed to successfully land a first stage of a rocket 
            back on earth, after releasing its payload into orbit. Flash-forward to 2021, Tesla is a couple steps away from making fully autonomous electric cars and SpaceX is planning 
            on sending an astronaut to Mars by 2025 with the help of NASA. The other companies Musk is involved in, such as, The Boring Company and Neuralink are thriving as well and are 
            showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
        </p>
        <h3>Summery</h3>
        <p>As a child, he was bullied for being who he was. 
            At the start of Tesla Motors, he was ridiculed by almost everyone in the field, nobody believed in his vision. 
            As for SpaceX, even giant figures in the industry such as, Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan, whom he had looked up to as child, opposed commercial space flight 
            in the way that he was developing it. 
            Despite all that, being the visionary that he was and still is, he persevered. He never backed down. Failure was never an option for him. 
            His persistence and unceasing determination are the secret ingredients to all the incredible feats that he’s accomplished. 
            Against all odds, from a bullied high school kid to an absolute icon in the tech world, Elon Musk’s story is an inspirational one, in every sense of the word.
